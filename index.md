### Hello !

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>Welcome to my personal page. Currently I am working on my PhD thesis at  <a href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/en">Institut Polytechnique de Paris</a> under the supervision of 
<a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/brandner/">Florian Brandner</a> and <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/lirida-naviner?l=en">Lirida Naviner</a>.</p>

<p>My current research interest is in Real-Time Embedded Systems. My thesis, more specifically, is on <em>designing safe and trustworthy memory systems</em> -- heavily relying on formal methods.</p>

<p>I consider my areas of expertise to be: processor micro-architecture, RISC-V processor optimisation, RTL design, critical and mixed-criticality real-time systems, concurrent programing, trusted execution environments (TEEs), bare metal development, OS(s), and micro-controllers. I've also developped a few small projects on other topics, such as: AI, distributed systems, cloud, robotics, connected objects, ultra-low-power electronic design, and mobile networks.</p>

### Professional Experience

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<ul>
<li> <strong> Graduate Research Intern at <a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com/">Collins Aerospace</a> (Jan 2023 - present) </strong>. I have been applying formal methods to verify customised microarchitectures. </li>

<li> <strong> Intern at <a href="https://www.trustonic.com/"> Trustonic </a> (Mar 2020 - Sep 2020) </strong>. I implemented a biometric library and provided sample-code for fingerprint and face-recognitionin applications in a resource-limited Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). I've also contributed to the TEE by enabling C++ support on the kernel. </li>

### Awards and Honors

- **Best Paper Award** (RTNS, 2022).

- **1st place at the 1st National RISC-V student contest** (Paris, France, 2021). Organised by Thales, CNFM, and the GdR SOC2.

- **CAPES BRAFITEC Excellence Double Degree Fellowship** (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2018). Granted by [CAPES](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br).

- **1st place at CoRA, the Autonomous Robot Competition** (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2016). Organised by [PETEE](http://www.petee.cpdee.ufmg.br/), School of Enginering, UFMG. Along with two teamates, I've designed a high speed line follower robot. Our robot's performance granted us first place in the competition. 

### Projects

- [Superscalar Processor Timing Anomalies Detector](https://github.com/felipelisboa-ml/RISC-V-competition). A software written in C to detect timing anomalies in super-scalar processor trace executions.

- [RISC-V National Competition](https://github.com/felipelisboa-ml/RISC-V-competition). My changes on the [Ariane](https://github.com/lowRISC/ariane) processor that awarded my first place on the 1st National RISC-V student contest.

### More

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p> I like being outside in nature as much as possible. Other passions are making music, sports, and languages. I am quite passionate about languages, actually. Currently I can speak fluent Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, Italian, and some basic German. </p>
