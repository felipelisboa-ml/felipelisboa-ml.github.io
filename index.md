### Hello !

Welcome to my personal page. Currently I am working on my PhD thesis at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) under the supervision of [Florian Brandner](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/brandner/) and [Lirida Naviner](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/lirida-naviner?l=en). 

My general topic of interest is Real-Time Embedded Systems. My thesis, more specifically, is on designing safe and trustworthy memory systems -- heavily relying on formal methods.

I consider my areas of expertise to be: processor micro-architecture, RISC-V processor optimisation, RTL design, critical and mixed-criticality real-time systems, concurrent/multi-core programing, trusted execution environments (TEEs), bare metal development, operational systems, and micro-controllers.

Moreover, I also have some knownledge (mostly through small projects) on: AI, data, distributed systems, cloud, robotics, connected objects, ultra-low-power electronic design, and mobile networks.

### Education

- PhD at Institut Polytechnique de Paris (2020-present). Thesis: Secure Dynamic Memory Hierarchy. Under the supervision of [Florian Brandner](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/brandner/) and [Lirida Naviner](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/lirida-naviner?l=en).

- MsC at Télécom Paris & Université Paris-Saclay (2018-2020). Thesis: Implementation of a biometric library in a multi-core Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

- BsC in Eletrical Engineering at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) (2015-2020).

- Technical Degree in Industrial Automation at Instituto Federal de Minas Gerais (IFMG) (2012-2014).

### Experience

- Intern at [Trustonic](https://www.trustonic.com/) (Mar 2020 - Sep 2020). I implemented a biometric library and provided sample-code for fingerprint and face-recognitionin applications in a resource-limited Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). I've also contributed to the TEE by enabling C++ support on the kernel.
