### Hello !

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p>Welcome to my personal page. Currently I am working on my PhD thesis at  <a href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/en">Institut Polytechnique de Paris</a> under the supervision of 
<a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/brandner/">Florian Brandner</a> and <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/lirida-naviner?l=en">Lirida Naviner</a>.</p>

<p>My main research interest is on using formal methods to design hardware. My latest experience is on developping memory controllers and cryptographic modules using the Coq proof assistant. Other sub-areas where I have (some) expertise are: RISC-V processor design & optimisation, critical and mixed-criticality Real-Time Embedded Systems, static analysis, concurrent programming, trusted execution environements (TEEs), bare metal code-writing & micro-controllers.</p>

<p>I've also developped a few small projects on other topics, such as: AI, distributed systems, cloud, robotics, connected objects, ultra-low-power electronic design, and mobile networks.</p>

### Awards and Honors

- **Best Paper Award** (RTNS, 2022).

- **1st place at the 1st National RISC-V student contest** (Paris, France, 2021). Organised by Thales, CNFM, and the GdR SOC2.

- **CAPES BRAFITEC Excellence Double Degree Fellowship** (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2018). Granted by [CAPES](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br).

- **1st place at CoRA, the Autonomous Robot Competition** (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2016). Organised by [PETEE](http://www.petee.cpdee.ufmg.br/), School of Enginering, UFMG. Along with two teamates, I've designed a high speed line follower robot. Our robot's performance granted us first place in the competition. 

### Research Projects

- [Superscalar Processor Timing Anomalies Detector](https://github.com/felipelisboa-ml/RISC-V-competition). A software written in C to detect timing anomalies in super-scalar processor trace executions.

- [RISC-V National Competition](https://github.com/felipelisboa-ml/RISC-V-competition). My changes on the [Ariane](https://github.com/lowRISC/ariane) processor that awarded my first place on the 1st National RISC-V student contest.

### Trivia

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p> I love languages. I speak Portuguese (mother tongue), English, French, Spanish, Italian, and some baisc German. I'll be beyond happy if you start a conversation with me in any of these languages (I love practicing).</p>
<p> Other than that, I love everything aviation-related. I also enjoy sports, my favorite is basketball -- is also play it, believe it or not. Will never say no to a good conversation over a pint.</p>
