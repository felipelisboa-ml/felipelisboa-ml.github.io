### Hello !

Welcome to my personal page. Currently I am working on my PhD thesis at Institut Polytechnique de Paris under the supervision of [Florian Brandner](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/brandner/) and [Lirida Naviner](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/lirida-naviner?l=en). 

My general topic of interest is Real-Time Embedded Systems. My thesis, more specifically, is on designing safe and trustworthy memory systems, which heavily relies on formal methods. 

I've also recently worked with processor architecture, RTL design, critical and mixed-criticality real-time embedded systems, and RISC-V designs. In the past, I've worked with a large range of topics, which can be checked below.

In this page you will find a resume of my education, professional experience, outreach, publications and github links to my projects.
